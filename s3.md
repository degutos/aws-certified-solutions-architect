### Example S3 urls

https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key-name

http://acloudguru.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Ralphie.jpg


- When uploading a file to an S3 bucket, you will receive an HTTP 200 response code if the upload was successful. 
- key usually is a name of object e.g. ralphie.jpg (file's name)
  


  ### ACLs vs Bucket policies


- ACLs work on an individual object level like a single file, you can make a file public or private, readable or writeable, download 
- Bucket policy work on an entire bucket level, if you want make all bucket publicly you can use bucket policy. 


- Buckets are private by the default. If you want turn it publicly you must allow public access on both the bucket and its objects.
- ACLs you can make individual objects public using object ACLs
- Bucket policies you can make entire bucket public using bucket policies
- When upload an object to s3 and it's successful you will receive an HTTP 200 code. 


### Creating our bucket 

- Lets create a new bucket called andregonzaga-bucket
- In Permissions make it "Block public access" as OFF
- Still in Permissions, in object ownership select the option "ACLs enabled"
